CKA Workshop
=====================

Japan CKA Workshop contents using educates and vcluster.

### Requirements:  
- Install educates  
TBD
- Install vcluster  
https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster

### Why vcluter?
Each educates workshop session is limited to a namespace, so ONLY namespaced resources can be deployed. To get rid of this limitation and let participants use the cluster freely and efficiently, vcluster is a good way.

### Quick Start
TBD
